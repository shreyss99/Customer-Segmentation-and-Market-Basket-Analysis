# FLAIR: Finding Loyalists & Analyzing Item Relations
## Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis on Online Retail Data

The 'Online Retail 2' is a transactional data set that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique, all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

But first, let's see some deep understanding of both concepts:

- **Customer segmentation** is the problem of uncovering information about a firm's customer base based on their interactions with the business. In most cases, this interaction is in terms of their purchase behavior and patterns. We explore some of the ways in which this can be used.
- **Market basket analysis** is a method to gain insights into the granular behavior of customers. This is helpful in devising strategies that uncover a deeper understanding of the purchase decisions taken by customers. This is interesting, as a lot of times even the customer will be unaware of such biases or trends in their purchasing behavior.
